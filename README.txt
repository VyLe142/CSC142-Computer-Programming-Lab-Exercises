2a/
1.	Enter data from user.
Calculate the average score of 3 tests.
Use if...else statement to classify the academic performance (A, B, C, D, F).
2.	I use the Scanner library to let the user enter 3 scores.
Then, I calculate the average of the 3 scores.
Finally, the program will print out the score type based on that average.
3.	Example: 
Enter score 1: 80
Enter score 2: 90
Enter score 3: 100
Total of three test scores: 90.0
Grade: A

Enter score 1: 100
Enter score 2: 70
Enter score 3: 70
Total of three test scores: 80.0
Grade: B

Enter score 1: 80
Enter score 2: 50
Enter score 3: 90
Total of three test scores: 73.33333333333333
Grade: C

Enter score 1: 60
Enter score 2: 60
Enter score 3: 70
Total of three test scores: 63.333333333333336
Grade: D

Enter score 1: 30
Enter score 2: 98
Enter score 3: 80
Total of three test scores: 69.33333333333333
Grade: F
4.	I had trouble deciding whether to use float or double, in the end I chose double because it has more precision.
2b/ 
1.	Know how to enter data from the user (Scanner)
Use if...else conditional statements
Know how to print formatted results
2.	User enters the number of checks
The program has a fixed fee of $10.00.
Depending on the number of checks, the program will charge a different fee for each check.
Then, the program adds them all together to print the total service fee.
3.	Example:
Enter number of checks: 500
Base fee: $10.0
Fee per check: $0.04
Total service charge: $30.00
4.	I had trouble adjusting the format and it took a while to get it right.
